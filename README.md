The calculator provides a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) for performing various mathematical calculations, including basic arithmetic operations, trigonometric functions, logarithmic functions, exponentiation, and more.

## Features:

- Simple and intuitive interface
- Support for basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- Trigonometric functions (sine, cosine, tangent)
- Logarithmic functions (log, log10)
- Exponentiation (power, square root)
- Memory functionality (store, recall, clear)
- Error handling for invalid inputs

## Requirements:

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter library

## Usage:

### Clone the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/your-username/scientific-calculator.git
```

### Install the required dependencies:

```shell
pip install tkinter
```

### Run the calculator:
